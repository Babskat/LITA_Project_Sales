# LITA_Project_Sales
### This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with Incubator HUB.
### This project is to analyze Sales data to determine key insights such as Regional performance, Sales trends and most popular product

## Project Overvies
### KATCLEAN VENTURES is a Clothing Store with Outlets in different locations in the four major Regions (East, North, South and West). Six major types of Clothings (Hat, Gloves, Jacket, Shirts, Shoes and Socks) are sold in these outlets and large volumes of data was gathered from the 6 Regions This project is aimed at finding insights such as Regional Performance, best selling Products, least selling products, month on month sales to help the management make smart decisions on how to take the organisation to the next level.
